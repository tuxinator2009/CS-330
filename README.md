# 3D Scene Reflection
My approach to designing software focuses on structuring projects in a way that balances modularity and efficiency. Working on my 3D scene helped refine my ability to break down complex objects into basic geometric shapes while applying textures and materials to enhance realism. I followed an iterative design process, starting with simple shapes and refining their attributes to achieve the desired look. By implementing a SceneObject structure and a centralized object list, I streamlined the rendering process, making it easy to adjust or expand the scene. This design strategy—focusing on reusable structures and modular organization—can be applied to future projects, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

When developing programs, I emphasize iterative refinement and structured problem-solving. While working on my 3D scene, I adopted new development strategies, such as dynamically managing objects through a structured data list instead of hardcoded function calls. Iteration played a crucial role, allowing me to tweak positioning, lighting, and textures efficiently. My coding approach has evolved to prioritize adaptability, making future modifications more seamless. Computational graphics and visualizations have expanded my skill set by strengthening my understanding of 3D transformations, lighting techniques, and rendering optimizations—knowledge that directly supports my goals in game development. These skills will also be valuable professionally, providing a solid foundation for creating visually immersive and technically sound applications.
